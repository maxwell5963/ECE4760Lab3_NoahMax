 * Description:
 *    This header file defines the sprite data and associated constants for our
 *    Super Mario Bros-inspired ECE 4760 final project.
 *
 *    We keep our sprite definitions in a dedicated header which
 *    helps prevent accidental modification â€” especially when working with AI 
 *    assistance tools or collaborative editing environments.
 *
 *    Arrays defined here are declared as `extern` to ensure single instantiation
 *    in the associated source (.c) file, allowing for efficient memory usage.
